**This readme is spoiler free, however the code obviously contains solutions.**

### Day 1
The day 1 challenges were relatively straight forward. It took a bit of time and some troubleshooting but managed to get them.

### Day 2
These challenges were quite a bit harder than yesterday. Quite a bit more googling and AI explaining.
I'm having AI generate solutions based off of mine and I can see how knowing some tricks makes things
much simpler. 

### Day 3 Part 1
A moderate challenge. I implemented some of the tricks I learned though the AI refactor of the previous challenges.
